/// Trait for the dot product operation.
/// 
/// The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) is the sum of the element-wise products of two vectors.
/// 
/// The `dot` method is only defined for [`Vector`](crate::vector::Vector) and [`RowVector`](crate::row_vector::RowVector).
/// However, the `dot` method accepts as an argument a [`Matrix`](crate::matrix::Matrix) or any of its views,
/// as long it represents a column or row vector respectively. That is, to `dot` with a [`Vector`](crate::vector::Vector)
/// of length `n`, the rhs must be a [`Matrix`](crate::matrix::Matrix) of shape `(n, 1)`.
/// Similarly for [`RowVector`](crate::row_vector::RowVector).
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// This example shows some of the possible dot product combinations.
/// 
/// ```
/// use ferrix::DotProduct;
/// use ferrix::{Vector, RowVector, Matrix};
/// 
/// // Dot product of two vectors
/// let a = Vector::from([1, 2, 3]);
/// let b = Vector::from([4, 5, 6]);
/// assert_eq!(a.dot(b), 32);
/// 
/// // Alternatively
/// let a = Vector::from([1, 2, 3]);
/// let b = Matrix::from([[4], [5], [6]]);
/// assert_eq!(a.dot(b), 32);
/// 
/// // Dot product of two row vectors
/// let a = RowVector::from([1, 2, 3]);
/// let b = RowVector::from([4, 5, 6]);
/// assert_eq!(a.dot(b), 32);
/// 
/// // Similarly
/// let a = RowVector::from([1, 2, 3]);
/// let b = Matrix::from([[4, 5, 6]]);
/// assert_eq!(a.dot(b), 32);
/// ```
